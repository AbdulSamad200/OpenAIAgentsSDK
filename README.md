# 🤖 OpenAI Agents SDK - Practice Lab

Welcome to my dedicated laboratory for mastering the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. This repository serves as a comprehensive practice hub where I explore, implement, and refine the core concepts of Agentic AI.

## 🎯 Project Mission

The purpose of this repository is to document my hands-on experience with building autonomous AI agents. It focuses on practical implementation rather than just theory, exploring how agents can reason, use tools, and collaborate to solve complex problems.

### Key Areas of Practice:
- **Agent Orchestration**: Mastering the flow of control and communication between multiple specialized agents.
- **Tool Integration**: Building and testing functional tools that allow agents to interact with the real world.
- **Safety & Compliance**: Implementing robust input and output guardrails to ensure reliable and safe AI behavior.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Exploring advanced patterns like Triage, Handoffs, and Dynamic Context Injection.
- **User Experience**: Integrating agents with modern conversational interfaces for real-time interaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/agents)
- **Intelligence**: **Google Gemini** (via OpenAI compatibility layer)
- **Orchestration**: Python 3.10+ with `uv` for high-performance dependency management.

## 🚀 Vision

This repo is a living document of my progress in the field of AI Engineering. By practicing these patterns, I aim to build systems that are not just conversational, but truly autonomous and helpful.
